# Session 4: NumPy Essentials for Data Analysts

This project covers the fundamental concepts of NumPy, including array creation, multi-dimensional indexing, and vectorized operations.

## Task Descriptions

### Task A: Basic
- Created a 1D array from a Python list.
- Inspected array properties such as `dtype` and `shape`.
- Performed basic scalar arithmetic (addition and multiplication).

### Task B: Intermediate
- Created and manipulated a 3x3 matrix.
- Used the `axis` parameter to calculate sums along rows and columns.
- Performed array slicing to extract specific subsets of data.
- Demonstrated array reshaping between different dimensions.

### Task C: Advanced
- Applied vectorized operations between two arrays.
- Demonstrated **Broadcasting**, showing how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes.
- Generated random data and performed aggregate statistical analysis.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
  ```
2. Execution:

If using the .py script: python session4_assignment.py

If using the .ipynb notebook: Open in Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab and run all cells.
